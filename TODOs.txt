-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ameliorations:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- to make a github page with examples and more thorough descriptions of the commands
- integrate unsplash api for !artme (50 calls per hour), not (only) our google drive examples?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Export to Raspberry PI (to have in mind):
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- make/update current script for installing and running everything on raspberry pi
   = to (re)start on the restart of the raspberry pi
   = to update automatically on any change from github
   = to have some easy way to edit env file (?)
   = to add an option to log in a file, as well (how to save it for a specific time for subsequent debugging?)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New ideas and functionality:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- an idea for exercises based on text prompts for characters/emotions/settings etc. - already we have !promptme
  = description: an idea to make !promptme as an automatic 'weekly' challenge 
  = how:
    - to decide how to define the settings, maybe in a google doc - for the time e.g. week and the channel name for the prompts
    - also maybe not just calling prompt but a combination of !artme + !promptme e.g. text + palette

- an idea for welcoming new people and assigning a role for them based on an invitation code e.g. `Welcome @Ani :wave:! You are our new valuable @shinobi!` :D
    = useful links:
      - https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#invite%C2%A0 
      - https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360058433271-Add-invite-data-to-user-joined-event
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfsfga-YxzI
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=my2F7ntvxb0
      - https://top.gg/bot/720351927581278219 (but the invites commands is paid?)  
    = how:
      - it is already done
      - there is a settings file with invites <code>:<role>
      BUT still to investigate how to automatically reload the data from the settings and take the correct invitations from Discord server
      current solution !reload but it is not working well for now
      to investigate about webhooks!!

- the Liybo's idea for real+digital stickers for #n successfully finished challenges - for now just real stickers! (lowest priority!)
  = description: every user will participate in different challenges and if their count reaches for example 10 challenges, he will receive some stickers/emojis
  = how:
    - add a command <!challenge @Ani @Liybo @Yasi> enumerating all the users that successfully finish the current challenge (at the end of it)
    - the command can be called only by people with some role - administrative/moderator
    - for example: 3 levels, after 10 challenges you go one level up, and you receive an access to 10 emojis as you have a new assigned role by the bot
    - in advance there are for example 3 predefined roles 
    - the bot will assign emojis for each role and if 10 challenges are finished, the bot will assign the new role
  = comments:
    - emojis in discord server by default are 50 custom emojis (with nitro/paid more)
    - api for emojis: https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/emoji to define the emojis by role
  = to be decided: is it ok to have for example another 3 new roles in the server? 

- a moderation functionality - the bot will be looking for following strictly the rules :D - no too much pictures in the common channel or too much English words/whole sentences
    = an example: https://mee6.xyz/moderation
    = how:
        - for example each person has a limit of 5 pictures in the common chat, after that:
            - an error message is sent
            - the image is deleted
            - maybe the person is muted for the end of the day in the common chat
            
        - it can be set for a specific guild and channel
        - maybe also use similar moderation in the "introduction server" if users start discussing instead of only posting pictures with discriptions of themselves

- a functionality for the rules 
    = an example: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360066916452-Built-in-Agree-to-Rules-function
    = how:
        - there will be one more role - "everyone_before_accepting_rules" - every new user has that role only with permissions to see the channel with the rules
        - after reading and reacting to the rules, the user will receive the current "everyone" role with the basic permissions

- automatic announcement for the new posts from the site of Manga Academy/facebook page? (again a specific channel for that?)

- Secret Santa (for cards/challenges) - sends DMs? (maybe with a table for the moderator who is calling the method?)

- GAN of two styles/pictures (are only two pictures enough) or something simpler with AI 
    = an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjDpW_SOrlw

- CMYK converter? based on photoshop 'sRGB Color Space Profile.icm', 'USWebCoatedSWOP.icc' (I already have the script in python but PIL in js)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code refactoring / Developing stuff
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- !artme feet with a new folder 'feet' should work but the description of the command stays the same (how to make the description dynamically?)
- to split mongo.js into separate modules?
- to read about and integrate unit tests for the discord bot (jest?)
- to investigate whether there are any restrictions for the number of queries a day or mb in mongodb 
  (although at some point the DB might be just on the raspberry pi, but maybe slower from SD card?)
